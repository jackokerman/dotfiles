# Writing style

## Technical terms in commits and PRs

Wrap technical identifiers in backticks for clarity:
- Feature flag names: `enable_dark_mode`
- File paths: `src/config/features.yaml`
- Function/class names: `ConfigParser`
- CLI commands: `npm run deploy`

Examples:
- Good: "Add `enable_dark_mode` feature flag"
- Bad: "Add enable_dark_mode feature flag"

## Formatting

Prefer conversational prose over heavy list/dash formatting. Avoid structuring everything as bullet points or numbered lists. Write naturally and use formatting sparingly, only when it genuinely aids clarity (like code blocks for code examples).

## Tone

Be informal but not too casual. Avoid stiff or overly formal phrasing, but don't sacrifice clarity for brevity.

## Sentence structure

Write complete sentences with subjects and verbs. The tone can be informal, but don't omit grammatical subjects.

- Good: "The service failed to connect. It retried three times before timing out."
- Bad: "Failed to connect. Retried three times before timing out."

## Punctuation

Avoid em dashes and en dashes. Use commas, parentheses, or separate sentences instead.

- Good: "Addressed your comments and responded to questions"
- Bad: "Addressed your comments - responded to questions"
